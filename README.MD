Version 0.0.1

The current version was made in "quick and dirty" mode, so it's not very good. I will try to improve it in the future.

The next setps are:

- [ ] Clean the main code.
- [ ] Enable the UART mode only for debug purposes.
- [ ] Do all the tests mode correctly.
- [ ] Add a manual mode to UART, for the developer send the commands to the module manually by serial port.
